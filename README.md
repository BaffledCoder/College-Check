This website has very less security so anyone can exploit it.
But it has nothing important to exploit.
I jst connected html code to firebase without any backend language like php so no sever side programming.
But still this project helped me to learn quite alot basic about firebase and web dev.
Right now i am in 3rd year home stuck due to covid-19.
alot of thing i did in this project are jugad like i still can't understand firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function(user) work in main page i.e index.html but not in app.html or check.html there var user = firebase.auth().currentUser; this work.
I am hosting this website on netlify.com
Alas this is so far my 2nd or 3rd project that i completed without getting bored.
